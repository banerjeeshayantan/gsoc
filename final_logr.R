#Correlation between two samples

#This gives the cross xorrelation between two signals.There is a strong negative correlation between the two signals
#According to the documentation SCoNEs rational is the logR ratio 
#between normal and tumor read depth is asignal which is composed of mixture of several gaussian for each copy number state and somehow for technical and artifical noise.
#Thus for sample 1, there are more number of data points with positive log ratios(CASES WHERE TUMOUR READ DEPTH IS GREATER THAN NORMAL)
length(which(data1$testSample2>0))

#Thus for sample 2, there are more number of data points with negative log ratios(CASES WHERE TUMOUR READ DEPTH IS LESSER THAN NORMAL)

#Below listed are two different methods for tackling noise
##METHOD 1 (OUTLIER DETECTION)
#For both the plots there are a lot of points which looks like outliers. We must design an efficient way to identify those
#For the vast amount of times, outliers are noise, which are points that are very different from the true data
#LOF compares the local density of an point to the local densities of its neighbors. It is an unsupervised approach and no labelling is necessary  
#Points that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors are considered outliers.
#Calling lof() on unique values only
lof_1=lof(unique(data1$testSample1),k=5) #neighborhood size considered is 5 for sample 1
lof_2=lof(unique(data1$testSample2),k=5) #neighborhood size considered is 5 for sample 2
#distribution of outlier factors
summary(lof_1)
hist(lof_1, breaks=10)
summary(lof_2)
hist(lof_2, breaks=10)
#Both the means are approximately centered around 1
#An lof value close to 1 indicates that an object is comparable to its neighbours and are not outliers
#A value below {\displaystyle 1} 1 indicates a denser region (which would be an inlier)
#while values significantly larger than 1 indicate outliers.

#although not so informative, the below plots show point size proportional to lof
### point size is proportional to LOF

text(unique(data1$testSample1)[lof_1>1.5], labels = round(lof_1, 1)[lof_1>1.5], pos = 3)

plot(unique(data1$testSample2), pch = ".", main = "LOF (k=3)")
points(unique(data1$testSample2), cex = (lof_2-1)*3, pch = 1, col="red")

#Removing those points
new_test_sample1=data1$testSample1[-index_1]
new_test_sample2=data1$testSample2[-index_2]

#Final preprocessed signal for both samples are stored in new_test_sample1 and new_test_sample2
#This method using local outlier factor has to be further tuned to get the best signal to noise ratio. This is just a naive implementation

#METHOD 2
#A Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter is a digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data, that is, 
#to increase the signal-to-noise ratio without greatly distorting the signal.
#The package signal needs to be installed

#Moving average method
#This method takes M samples of input at a time and take the average of those M-samples and produces a single output point.
